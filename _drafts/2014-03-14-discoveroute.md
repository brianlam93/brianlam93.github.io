Discoveroute came out of a course I took Winter 2014, CS 147: Introduction to Human Computer Interaction Design. The class was organized into smaller sections, called studios. Each studio had its own theme, into which each group's project must fit; my section's theme was Education.With such a broad topic, my team decided early on that we were most interested in the indirect learning space, in which the user is acquiring knowledge not as the end goal, but as a byproduct of their interaction with our product. With Discoveroute, we enrich a user's knowledge and understanding of their surroundings by making urban exploration easier and less disruptive. 

Discoveroute breaks the monotony of a daily routine, without disrupting the user's plans. Given a start and end location, a desired arrival time, and a category for a place of interest, Discoveroute suggests a place off the user's beaten path, without running the user late.
