When I received my college acceptance letter, my first thoughts were surprise,
then joy, then punctuated by disbelief. My next move was clearly to call the
admissions office and verify that a mistake had not been made. It wasn't that
crazy of an idea; that exact situation happened a couple of years earlier to
some of my friends.

When the reality of being accepted to one of my top choice schools began to sink
in. I didn't feel the same "I will be found out and they will kick me out"
imposter syndrome, but it came on in a different form. I felt a deep guilt about
my application. I felt that I had over embellished and was overly narcissistic
about my accomplishments and the impact that I said I had on my school and
community. I felt guilty about invoking the minority card when I talked about
the less than stellar upbringing that I had and the imperfect conditions that I
endured and despite of which excelled. This rationalization is deeply real to
me. That the person that I had painted myself maybe did deserve to receive and
admission letter, but the separation between me and that person was too great. I
will be found out that I had lied.

Once I started in the fall, I began to fall behind. I went out every weekend,
focused on making friends and, more importantly, making my involvement in school
look as effortless as the other students made it seem. To struggle was a fate
that I had chosen for myself, since I painted myself as someone more capable
than I really was, and to reach out for help was an admission of my own guilt,
lies, and wrongdoing.

I fell back on the one thing I truly disliked - false lack of interest. When my
performance didn't meet my desired expectations, I looked for as many other
sources of blame as possible. The TA was incompetent; I had other priorities
that are more important to me. Still, through it all, I was embarrassed by my
failures. Honestly, failure was not something I was accustomed to. 

I began to accept that even working hard did not pan out to the results that I
wanted. In retrospect, brute forcing my way through things was not a good recipe
for success anyways, as brute force methods do not scale well.

I think what contributes to the reality of imposter syndrome was success was not as easily attained in college as it was before, and that change in feeling invalidated what made me confident in the past, and lead me to call into question how valid I was in being confident in myself when applying for school. Struggling felt different because it did not draw the same kind of success as before. I think now is that the magnitude of work was different in such a way that my previous work techniques didn't scale to. It wasn't because the work was beyond me, but I was simply not accustomed to being pushed for time the same way I was in college. 

Did I set myself up for failure by biting off more than I can chew?

The main things to consider are

Struggling is not further evidence of being an imposter. Methodology for reaching success change in changing environments
Reach out for help. Trying to refigure everything out on your own is impossible in a short enough timespan. You owe it to yourself to get help in orienting yourself appropriately. 

1. find role models for success
2. find support groups
3. recognize that the success of others is is not a personal failure - this is not a zero sum game

A good coping mechanism is to imagine that whatever hurdle you believe you unfairly cleared cannot be rescinded. Instead, there is an inspection sometime in the future that you have to then prepare for. Train for this one instead of letting something drag you down. Take steps that by the time the next inspection comes, you are not the imposter that you were.

If you're an imposter now, you don't always have to remain an imposter.

Other thing, of course there's an inspection coming up. It's whatever goal you set next.

Imagine that no-one is going to reinspect your past so a sudden firing is not likely. Instead, if you live despondently waiting to be fired, your present performance will definitely not be good.
