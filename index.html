  Hi, I'm Brian Lam. I am a software engineer at Instagram. I previously worked
  on Facebook's Ads products. Before that, I was a
  student at Stanford University, where I received my Bachelor's Degree in
  Computer Science (and left before completing my Master's Degree in Computer Science).
  I am not actively looking for new work now, but this is
  <a href="/me">my résumé</a>.
</p>
<p>
  I live and work in San Francisco. In my free time, I like cooking, trying out
  new restaurants, drinking coffee, making cocktails for friends at home, and
  thinking about whether I am once and for all an introvert or just sleepy. I
  have also picked up climbing.
</p>
<p>
  I write about some of my side projects <a href="/blog">here</a>.
