  Hi, I'm Brian Lam. I am a software engineer at Facebook. Previously, I was a
  student at Stanford University, where I received my Bachelor's Degree in
  Computer Science. I am not actively looking for new work now, but this is
  <a href="/me">my résumé</a>.
</p>
<p>
  I live and work in San Francisco. In my free time, I like cooking, trying out
  new restaurants, drinking coffee, and thinking about whether I'm an introvert or
  just sleepy. I have also picked up climbing.
</p>
<p>
  I write about some of my side projects <a href="/blog">here</a>.
