Hi, I'm Brian Lam. I am a software engineer at Instagram. I previously worked
on Facebook's Ads products. Before that, I was a
student at Stanford University, where I received my Bachelor's Degree in
Computer Science (and left before completing my Master's Degree in Computer Science).
I am not actively looking for new work now, but this is [my résumé](/me).

I live and work in San Francisco. In my free time, I like cooking, trying out
new restaurants, drinking coffee, making cocktails for friends at home, and
thinking about whether I am once and for all an introvert or just sleepy. I
have also picked up climbing. I recently got back into photography - you can
see my not so recently taken photos from Africa [here](/photos).

I write about some of my side projects [here](/blog).
